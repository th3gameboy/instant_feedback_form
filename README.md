# instant_feedback_form
An instant feedback form for a fictional coffeehouse that takes the information and sends it to the recipients email.

Greetings technocrats, console cowboys and cowgirls;
To hone my skills, I am endeavoring to create a project daily using AI tools.
The project I created today was an Instant Feedback Form for a coffeehouse. Let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúBrewed Awakening‚Äù.
Imagine this: You have your cup of coffee from Brewed Awakening and love it (or hate it)! You use their QR code and are directed to their feedback form called ‚ÄúEspresso Yourself‚Äù where you can leave your name, email, feedback type, a rating out of 5 cups, and a text box where you can ‚Äúspill the beans‚Äù or discuss your experience.
This information then goes directly to the owner‚Äôs inbox so they can read about and in the future improve your experience.
I had fun with this one.
Initially, I asked Grok-2 on X in its ‚Äúfun‚Äù mode to write me a list of fun, quick projects to do. I took its first suggestion:
‚ÄúInstant Feedback Form - Use V0 to design a clean, attractive feedback form UI. Cursor can then automate the backend to instantly email feedback to you or store it in a simple database. It's like having your own personal survey bot.
* V0: Design the form with a modern look.
* Cursor: Quick script to handle form submission.‚Äù Here is a chronological summary of this project, including the v0 frontend design and implementation phases.
I used Claude MCP to help me craft a v0 prompt to get the best results:
‚ÄúCreate a feedback form component with:
Name input (required)
Email input (required) with validation
A dropdown for coffee-themed feedback types: ‚òï Perfect Brew (Excellent) ü•§ Need an Extra Shot (Good but needs more) ‚ô®Ô∏è Too Hot to Handle (Issues) ü´ñ Not My Cup of Tea (Concerns) ‚ú® Fresh Beans Idea (Suggestions)
Rating display using coffee bean icons (1-5)
A text area labeled 'Spill the beans...' for detailed feedback
Submit button with loading state
Success toast message with a coffee pun
Warm, coffee-inspired color scheme
Make it responsive and accessible using shadcn/ui components.‚Äù
v0 generated three files for implementation:
page.tsx
coffee-feedback-form.tsx
use-feedback-form.ts
From there I went to Cursor. Here is the development environment setup:
1. Initialized Next.js project with:
TypeScript
ESLint
Tailwind CSS
App Router
2. Installed Required Dependencies:
@shadcn/ui core
Selected components: button, card, input, label, select, textarea, toast
lucide-react for icons
nodemailer for email functionality
Project Structure Implementation:
1. Frontend Components:
Placed coffee-feedback-form.tsx in components folder
Created form UI with amber color scheme
Implemented all form elements: Name input field, Email input, Coffee-themed dropdown, Coffee icon rating system, Detailed feedback text area, submit button with loading state
2. Form Logic:
Created use-feedback-form.tsx in hooks folder
Implemented: form state management, input validation, submission handling, toast notifications, loading states
3. Email Integration:
Set up Mailtrap for testing
Configured SMTP settings
Created email templates
Added error handling
Issue Resolution (because I did have some issues getting the app to work!)
1. Fixed TypeScript Errors:
Component props typing
2. Resolved Styling Issues:
Dropdown menu transparency to white
Toast notification formatting
Color scheme consistency
3. Email configuration fixes:
Proper Mailtrap integration
Email template formatting
In the end, with everything cleaned up we had a working Instant Feedback Form with: 1. User Interface:
Coffee-themed design
Responsive layout
Accessible components
Consistent amber color scheme
2. Functionality:
Form validation
Email submission
Success/error notifications
Test environment with Mailtrap
3. Ready for Production:
Easy transition from Mailtrap to production email service
Scalable component structure
Maintainable codebase
I had a lot of fun with this project. It clearly can be made and adapted to a variety of businesses. Also, instead of emailing directly to a recipient address, it could be sent to a database.
I‚Äôll definitely be using v0 for more frontend work! Thanks for reading! Feel free to take any of this information for yourself.
